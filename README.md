Roza wanted to utilize her Belly Button data samples and program a functioning website where users, with anonymized IDs, could looks up their unique data to find the probable match for the bacteria used in the Improbable Beef Burger.  

Roza learned to create basic plots with Plotly Javascript library, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, while using D3.json() to fetch external data. Next, she practiced functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data and increase her js knowledge. One of the unique features is an interactive data visualization that uses event handlers in JavaScript.


One of the advantages of programming in JavaScript is that the web browser is a tool both for development and debugging. So fortunately, Roza does not need to install any software to complete this project. She used:

1. VS Code
2. A Functioning Web Browser like Google Chrome
3. Plotly and Document Driver Document Javascript Libraries
4. Github Live Pages 

Her result is a live website with interactive data visualizations.
